The Grain Size Distribution Tool is a spatially explicit network model that estimates grain size (substrate size) at the watershed level at the reach scale. 

### What is this repository for? ###

* This program is meant to model the grain size of the substrate in a reach using the equation found in Snyder et al (2013).
* The tool is currently not finished, and does not run properly. Do not be surprised if it doesn't work yet.

### How do I get set up? ###

* As of now, you can't.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Braden Anderson
